## Insights from the Healthcare Data Dashboard  

**Total Wait List Comparison**:The dashboard compares the current year's (CY) latest month waitlist to the previous year's (PY) latest month waitlist.
**Current Year (CY)**: 709K patients are on the waitlist.
**Previous Year (PY)**: 640K patients were on the waitlist.
**Insight**: There has been an increase in the waitlist by 69K patients compared to the previous year, which may indicate growing demand or slower processing times.  

**Overall Waitlist Distribution**:A donut chart shows that the overall waitlist is approximately 54.38% comprised of a certain category.
**Insight**: The majority of the waitlist is concentrated in this category, which could be a focal point for optimizing healthcare delivery.  

**Average/Median Wait List by Time Bands and Age Profile**:The bar chart categorizes the waitlist data by different time bands (e.g., 18+ months, 0-3 months) and age profiles (0-15, 16-64, 65+).
**Insight**: Older patients (65+) have longer wait times, especially in the 18+ months category, highlighting a potential area of concern in managing care for elderly patients.  

**Top 5 Specialties with the Longest Waitlists**:The specialties with the highest average wait times are listed, with Pediatric Dermatology having the longest wait time at 167.89 days.
**Insight**: Pediatric specialties, especially Dermatology and ENT, are facing significant wait times, which might require resource allocation or process improvement to address these bottlenecks.  

**Monthly Trend Analysis - Day Case/Inpatient vs Outpatients**:The line chart tracks the sum of waitlists over time, broken down by case type (Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient).
**Insight**: Outpatient waitlists have shown a steady increase over the years, particularly peaking around mid-2019, indicating a growing challenge in managing outpatient services.

**Date Range Selector**: Users can filter the data by a specific date range, allowing for analysis of trends over different periods.
**Specialty and Case Type Filters**: Filters allow users to focus on specific specialties or case types, making the dashboard versatile

## 1. Data Segmentation by Date
**Date Range**: The dashboard allows users to select a date range (from January 31, 2018, to March 31, 2021) to analyze the data within a specific timeframe.
**Archival Date**: The data is likely archived at regular intervals, with a detailed view for a specific date (March 31, 2021).  

## 2. Healthcare Case Types
**Case Types Analyzed:-**   
**The data is categorized by three main case types:**
**Day Case**: Procedures that do not require an overnight stay.
**Inpatient**: Patients who stay in the hospital for at least one night.
**Outpatient**: Patients who visit for treatment but do not stay overnight.
T**otal Cases**: The dashboard aggregates the total number of cases, with a cumulative sum shown in the last column.  

## 3. Age Profile
**Age Groups:-**   
The data is further broken down by age profiles, covering:-
0-15 Years
16-64 Years
65+ Years  
**Time Bands**: Each age group is analyzed based on different time bands (e.g., 3-6 months, 6-9 months, 15-18 months), possibly to track the duration since a certain treatment or condition onset.  

## 4. Specialty Focus
**Orthopaedics Data**: The data shown in the dashboard is filtered to focus on the Orthopaedics specialty, providing detailed counts for different age groups and case types within this specialty.
**Total Patients**: The total number of patients treated within this specialty on the selected date is summarized, giving healthcare professionals an understanding of patient distribution.  

## 5. Granular Insights
**Patient Load Analysis**: By looking at the counts for each category (Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient), healthcare administrators can analyze the patient load, which helps in resource planning and allocation.
**Comparison Across Age Groups**: The breakdown by age groups and time bands allows for a comparative analysis of how different demographics are impacted by the specialty, which could inform age-specific healthcare strategies.  

## 6. Filter Customization
**User Interaction**: The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to customize their view by applying filters like Case Type, Age Profile, Time Bands, and Specialty Name. This flexibility enables users to focus on the most relevant data for their needs.  

## 7. Healthcare Resource Allocation
**Total Patient Count**: The cumulative total of patients (24,640,969) highlights the overall scale of healthcare services provided, which can be used for high-level strategic planning.  

## 8. Visual Presentation
**User Interface**: The dashboard uses a dark theme with contrasting colors for filters and data tables, making the information easy to read and navigate. This is likely intended to enhance user experience and reduce visual strain.
**Operational Efficiency**: Hospital administrators can use this data to assess the efficiency of healthcare delivery over time.
**Resource Management**: Insights into patient numbers can inform decisions on staffing, equipment allocation, and bed management.
**Demographic Analysis**: Healthcare providers can tailor interventions for specific age groups based on the patterns observed in the dashboard.
