## Insights from the Healthcare Data Dashboard  

**Total Wait List Comparison**:The dashboard compares the current year's (CY) latest month waitlist to the previous year's (PY) latest month waitlist.
**Current Year (CY)**: 709K patients are on the waitlist.
**Previous Year (PY)**: 640K patients were on the waitlist.
**Insight**: There has been an increase in the waitlist by 69K patients compared to the previous year, which may indicate growing demand or slower processing times.  

**Overall Waitlist Distribution**:A donut chart shows that the overall waitlist is approximately 54.38% comprised of a certain category (possibly outpatient or inpatient, though the specific category is not labeled in the provided portion of the image).
**Insight**: The majority of the waitlist is concentrated in this category, which could be a focal point for optimizing healthcare delivery.  

**Average/Median Wait List by Time Bands and Age Profile**:The bar chart categorizes the waitlist data by different time bands (e.g., 18+ months, 0-3 months) and age profiles (0-15, 16-64, 65+).
**Insight**: Older patients (65+) have longer wait times, especially in the 18+ months category, highlighting a potential area of concern in managing care for elderly patients.  

**Top 5 Specialties with the Longest Waitlists**:The specialties with the highest average wait times are listed, with Pediatric Dermatology having the longest wait time at 167.89 days.
**Insight**: Pediatric specialties, especially Dermatology and ENT, are facing significant wait times, which might require resource allocation or process improvement to address these bottlenecks.  

**Monthly Trend Analysis - Day Case/Inpatient vs Outpatients**:The line chart tracks the sum of waitlists over time, broken down by case type (Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient).
**Insight**: Outpatient waitlists have shown a steady increase over the years, particularly peaking around mid-2019, indicating a growing challenge in managing outpatient services.

**Date Range Selector**: Users can filter the data by a specific date range, allowing for analysis of trends over different periods.
**Specialty and Case Type Filters**: Filters allow users to focus on specific specialties or case types, making the dashboard versatile
